# Software Workers Guild Manifesto

The Software Workers Guild is for the people who design, build, and maintain software. Our software is interesting, creative, boundary-pushing, playful, thoughtful, and above all ethical. We take software seriously and don't want to see it tied down by clickbait, ad revenue, or greed. We value readability, privacy, teaching, reading a good book every once in a while, and taking care of our planet.

## Manifesto, unabridged

### Who is the software worker?

The software worker is someone who calls herself an engineer, a designer, a hacker, a programmer, a computer scientist, a tinkerer. She could be an intern; she could be a lead engineer. She might not be employed in tech at all but creates software in her spare time. She might be most interested in security, or in backend web development, or in UX design. She's comfortable using a computer and writing code in whatever language she prefers.

Software workers can be any gender, any race, of any ability or socio-economic background. What ties them together is their appreciation of good software. 

### What software do we make?

We welcome all kinds of software. Static websites, complex websites, handy little Python scripts, games, mobile apps, whatever. As long as it's made with code, designed with care, and subscribes to our values, it's software we're interested in.

### What software do we value?

When we create software, we remember something important: this is made by people, for people. We like software that is well-designed, accessible, readable, and helps the user. We like software that is simply *fun* to build, that we can learn from and get excited about. We like software that has a positive impact on both the software worker and whoever her audience is. Maybe the software makes them happier, or it makes a tedious task easier. It has value outside of dollars and cents.

Our software respects people's privacy. It respects their identities. It respects their abilities. It respects people.

It also respects the planet. Software takes energy to build and maintain. We value software that minimizes the impact on our planet.

### What software do we reject?

We are not interested in software that unfairly taxes the worker; that spies on users; that destroys privacy, relationships, and well-being; that is created for the sole purpose of making someone else rich. We do not support software that might be used by the military or to harrass migrants. We do not support software that marginalizes. We do not support software that makes it hard for the software worker to sleep at night or wastes her creative potential.
