# Software Workers Guild Manifesto

The Software Workers Guild is for the people who design, build, and maintain software. Our software is interesting, creative, boundary-pushing, playful, thoughtful, and above all ethical. We take software seriously and don't want to see it tied down by clickbait, ad revenue, or greed. We value readability, privacy, teaching, reading a good book every once in a while, and taking care of our planet.

Below we dive deeper into each of these points.

## Who is the software worker?

The software worker is someone who calls herself an engineer, a designer, a hacker, a programmer, a computer scientist, a tinkerer. She could be an intern; she could be a lead engineer. She might not be employed in tech at all but creates software in her spare time. She might be most interested in security, or in backend web development, or in UX design. She's comfortable using a computer and writing code in whatever language she prefers.

Software workers can be any gender, any race, of any ability or socio-economic background. What ties them together is their appreciation of good software. 

## What software do we make?

We welcome all kinds of software. Static websites, complex websites, handy little Python scripts, games, mobile apps, whatever. As long as it's made with code and designed with care, it's software we're interested in.

No software is inferior to another as long as it subscribes to our values.

## What software do we value?

When we create software, we remember something important: this is made by people, for people. We like software that is well-designed, accessible, readable, and helps the user. We like software that is simply *fun* to build, that we can learn from and get excited about. We like software that improves both the software worker and whoever her audience is. That might just mean that both she and her users are a little happier at the end of the day. To us, that's the mark of good software. 

## What software do we reject?
