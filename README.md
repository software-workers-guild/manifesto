# Software Workers Guild Manifesto

The Software Workers Guild is for the people who design, build, and maintain software. Our software is interesting, creative, boundary-pushing, playful, thoughtful, and above all ethical. We take software seriously and don't want to see it tied down by clickbait, ad revenue, or greed. We value readability, privacy, teaching, and reading a good book every once in a while.
